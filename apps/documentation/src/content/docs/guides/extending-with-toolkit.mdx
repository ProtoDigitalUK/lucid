title: Extending With Toolkit
description: Learn how you can extend Lucid with custom endpoints and toolkit.
---

Lucid provides a toolkit which allows you to programmatically call the client integration services within your application.

## Custom Endpoint

When paired up with Fastify, you can create custom endpoints to better tailor Lucid to your needs. In the example bellow we are createing a custom endpoint to get a paginated list of documents that bellong to the page collection.

All services return errors as values giving you the flexibility to handle them as you see fit, however you can use the `LucidAPIError` class to throw them to Lucid which will handle the error appropriately and return a formatted error response to the client.

```ts title="index.ts"
import lucid, { toolkit } from "@lucidcms/core";
import { LucidAPIError, formatAPIResponse } from "@lucidcms/core/api";

lucid.fastify.get("/get-documents", async (request, reply) => {
  const PAGE = 1;
  const PER_PAGE = 10;

  const res = await toolkit.document.getMultiple({
    collectionKey: "page",
    query: {
      page: PAGE,
      perPage: PER_PAGE,
    },
  });
  if (res.error) throw new LucidAPIError(res.error);

  reply.send(
    formatAPIResponse(request, {
      data: res.data.data,
      pagination: {
        count: res.data.count,
        page: PAGE,
        perPage: PER_PAGE,
      },
    })
  );
});

lucid.start();
```

## Toolkit Services

Currently the toolkit only supports a handful of services, but none the less, this is still a very powerful feature.

Here is the list of what is currently supported:

### Documents

```ts title="index.ts"
const { error, data } = await toolkit.document.getSingle({
  collectionKey: "page",
  query: {
    filter: {
      fullSlug: {
        value: "/about",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

> In this example, the `fullSlug` filter would be a custom field that has been added to the page collection.

```ts title="index.ts"
const { error, data } = await toolkit.document.getMultiple({
  collectionKey: "page",
  query: {
    filter: {
      documentId: {
        value: [1, 2, 3],
        operator: "in", // optional, defaults to '=', then 'in' if the value is an array
      },
    },
    page: 1,
    perPage: 10,
  },
});
```

> All available document column filters are prefixed with `document` as to hopefully not conflict with the custom field keys.

### Locales

```ts title="index.ts"
const { error, data } = await toolkit.locale.getAll();
```

> Returns all locales that have been configured in your `lucid.config.ts` file.

### Email

```ts title="index.ts"
const { error, data } = await toolkit.email.sendEmail({
  to: "hello@williamyallop.com",
  subject: "Hello",
  template: "password-reset",
  data: {
    firstName: "William",
  },
});
```

> You can use first party templates, though more likley you will want to use a custom template which you can do by adding a `mjml` file in a `templates` directory at the root of your project. Learn more about mjml [here](https://mjml.io/).
