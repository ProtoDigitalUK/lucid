This plugin registers the required media strategy functions to stream, upload, update and delete media from the specified local directory.

## Installation

To install the Local Storage plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

<PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
        ```shell 
        npm i @lucidcms/plugin-local-storage
        ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
        ```shell 
        pnpm i @lucidcms/plugin-local-storage
        ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
        ```shell 
        yarn add @lucidcms/plugin-local-storage
        ```
    </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Configuration

To use the Local Storage plugin, you need to add it to your `lucid.config.ts` or `lucid.config.js` file. This accepts an `uploadDir` value which is the directory where the uploaded files will be stored. This is relative to the root of your project.

```ts title="lucid.config.ts"
import lucid from "@lucidcms/core";
import LucidLocalStorage from "@lucidcms/plugin-local-storage";

export default lucid.config({
  // ...other config
  plugins: [
    LucidLocalStorage({
      uploadDir: "./uploads",
    }),
  ],
});
```
