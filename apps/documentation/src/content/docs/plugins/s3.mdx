This plugin registers the required media strategy functions to stream, upload, update and delete media from any S3 compatible storage solution.

## Installation

To install the S3 plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

<PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
        ```shell 
        npm i @lucidcms/plugin-s3
        ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
        ```shell 
        pnpm i @lucidcms/plugin-s3
        ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
        ```shell 
        yarn add @lucidcms/plugin-s3
        ```
    </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Configuration

To use the S3 plugin, you need to add it to your `lucid.config.ts` or `lucid.config.js` file. You will need to provide it connection details to your bucket.

```ts title="lucid.config.ts"
import lucid from "@lucidcms/core";
import LucidS3 from "@lucidcms/plugin-s3";

export default lucid.config({
  // ...other config
  plugins: [
    LucidS3({
      clientConfig: {
        endpoint: `https://${process.env.LUCID_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`,
        region: "auto",
        credentials: {
          accessKeyId: process.env.LUCID_S3_ACCESS_KEY as string,
          secretAccessKey: process.env.LUCID_S3_SECRET_KEY as string,
        },
      },
      bucket: "my-lucid-bucket",
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Bucket Configuration

As Lucid uses presigned URLs to upload media from the client, you will need to configure your S3 bucket's CORS policy. This will need to allow `PUT` requests, along with the `Content-Type` and `Origin` headers.

### Example Cloudflare R2 CORS Policy

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT"
    ],
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "Origin",
      "Content-Type"
    ]
  }
]
```
